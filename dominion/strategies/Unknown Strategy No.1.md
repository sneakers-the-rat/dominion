Idk i just got a shitload of points, i only had liek 2 gold and 1 silver and 1 copper.... but i had 42 VP where freaking [[Lord Rattington]] has onlt 19. I stacked the shit out of the archives so they were feeding me cards every time, and then i also was playing the patricians over themselves to draw the provinces out of my draw pile. but i can't think of a reason why this should be so dominant.
