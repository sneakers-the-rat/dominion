[[Jonny]]
[[Strategy]]
Combination of [[Baker]], [[Lackeys]], [[Bishop]], and [[Goons]]. A strategy where you basically don't get victory points or money the usual way.

- Baker gets you a stack of [[Coffers]] , which you need because this is an [[Engine|Action-driven]] deck. Also lets you cycle
- Lackeys let you get [[Villager]]s so that you can play everything all the time, also let you [[Trash and Gain Victory Points]].
- Bishop gets you consistent stream of victory points, lets you trash the lackeys so they dont pollute the hand. really adds up over time
- Goons also gets you a good amount of victory points, especially if you stack them (thanks to the extra villagers from Lackeys), and keeps your opponents suppressed.
