[[Jonny]]

Uses cards:
[[Recruiter]]
[[Fortress]]
[[Way of the Otter]]


Needs Any:
[[+ Buys]]

Strategy:
* If you use [[Recruiter]] to trash [[Fortress]], you get +4 actions +2 Cards, 
* if you just have [[Fortress]] you can still +1 Card +2 Action. 
* If you also have [[Way of the Otter]] or any other way to [[+ Card]], then you can also +2 cards and just live off the [[Villager]]s. 
* If you have [[+ Buys]] (in this case [[Cauldron]], but there are probs better), then you can just buy everything and [[Infinite Cycle]] your deck perpetually lmao
